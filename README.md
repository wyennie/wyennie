I'm a software engineer currently based in Long Island, New York with proficiency in Node/JavaScript, Ruby, Golang, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Docker, Terraform, and various AWS services. I have a passion for solving problems, learning new things, and making the world a better place. Recently I worked on an open-source project, Firefly.
