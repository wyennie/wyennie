Hi, my name is Will
---
I'm a full-stack software engineer with proficiency in JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, React, PostgreSQL, AWS, Docker, AI Model Integration, OpenAI, Anthropic and more! I have a passion for solving problems and figuring out how all the pieces fit together. 

Last year I co-created an observability framework for serverless functions, Firefly (see case study here).

More recently I made open-source contributions to, ZenML, an MLOps company, by integrating chatbot functionality within their VSCode extension.
